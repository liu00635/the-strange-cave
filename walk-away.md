You walk away, leaving the cave and its strange hum behind. The cold wind fades as you focus on the trail ahead. Leaves rustle, and gravel crunches under your boots. Sunlight shines through the trees, warming your face and easing your mind.

As you go deeper into the mountains, the forest feels alive. Birds sing, branches sway, and you hear a stream in the distance. The uneasy feeling from the cave fades, replaced by the calm beauty around you. You stop for a moment, looking at the wide valley below, and feel peaceful. Whatever was in the cave is now part of the wild, and you continue your hike.

As you walk deeper into the forest, something feels strange. The quiet seems too still, and a couple of times, you think you see something move in the corner of your eye but when you look, thereâ€™s nothing there.
